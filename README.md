## Learnings 

In that project, I learned how to create a login system using Spring Security and JWT(JSON Web Token ) tokens to structure a login system. I also learned and implemented the unit tests using Mockito and JUnit. To create the integration tests, I went up a MySQL container so the tests are near a production application. I learned how to implement a docker-compose. I implemented a CI/CD in the GitHub main of my project. After the update, that update will reflected in the Docker Hub repository, generating a new latest version.
